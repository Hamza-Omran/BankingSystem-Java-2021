# BankProject (First-Year Java Project - Archived)

## About This Repository

This project was created during my first year in college while learning Java and desktop application development with Swing.
It is uploaded only for historical reference and does not reflect my current coding standards.

## What the Project Does

A simple Java Swing desktop app that simulates a basic bank system:

- Create new client accounts
- Log in with username/password
- View balance, certificates, loans, deposits
- Navigate through multiple GUI pages

The project uses:

- Java Swing for GUI
- Simple in-memory data storage (no database)
- Basic OOP concepts and event-driven programming

## Important Notice

This code was written in Year 1 and kept exactly as is:

- No architecture (spaghetti-style code)
- Hardcoded values and UI layout
- No separation of concerns
- No database (data resets every run)
- Minimal validation and basic logic
- Not representative of my current skill level

I am keeping it for transparency and as part of my learning journey.

## Why Upload It?

- To preserve early work and show growth
- To document where I started
- To keep an archive of my first GUI project
- To contrast with the structured projects I write today

## My Current Skills (Compared to Year 1)

Since building this, I have gained experience in:

- C# & .NET Desktop development
- Clean architecture, layering, modularization
- REST APIs & full backend systems
- SQL databases & indexing
- Authentication, validation & security best practices
- Professional error handling
- Scalable, maintainable code structures
- Full-stack development practices

My modern repositories reflect my actual level today.

## Tech Used (Historical)

- Java SE
- Java Swing
- NetBeans / IntelliJ IDEA
- No external libraries
- No database
- Basic collections (ArrayList)
