## About This Repository

This project was created during my first year in college while learning Java and desktop application development with Swing.
It is uploaded only for historical reference and does not reflect my current coding standards.

## What the Project Does

A simple Java Swing desktop application that simulates a basic banking system. It allows users to:

* Create new client accounts
* Log in using a generated user ID and password
* View account balance, certificates, deposits, and loans
* Navigate through multiple GUI pages

Technologies and concepts used:

* Java Swing for GUI
* In-memory data storage (no database)
* Basic object-oriented programming
* Event-driven programming

## Important Notice

This code was written during my first year and has been kept unchanged for historical purposes:

* No architectural structure
* Hardcoded values and manually positioned UI elements
* No separation of concerns
* No database; all data resets on application restart
* Minimal validation and basic logic
* Not representative of my current skill level or development practices

I am keeping it publicly available to document my learning progression.

## Why Upload It?

* To preserve early work and show growth over time
* To document how my development skills evolved
* To archive my first GUI-based project
* To contrast with my later structured and professional projects

## My Current Skills (Compared to Year 1)

Since creating this project, I have gained significant experience in:

* C# and .NET desktop application development
* Clean architecture, layered systems, and modular design
* REST API development and backend engineering
* SQL databases, indexing, and relational schema design
* Input validation, authentication, and secure coding practices
* Scalable and maintainable code organization
* Full-stack development principles

My recent repositories represent my current professional level.

## Tech Used (Historical)

* Java SE
* Java Swing
* NetBeans / IntelliJ IDEA
* No external libraries
* No database
* Basic Java collections (ArrayList)

## Project Status
